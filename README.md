Add Search Engines to SeaMonkey

About
-----

[SeaMonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/) is already prepared to add
OpenSearch definitions to its search-bar, if they are provided by web pages.
It uses the same codebase [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/) does.

The only thing not implemented is the detection mechanism.

This add-on suppplies this functionality.
